# Ecosystem context

This repo (echo-types) is one node in the hyperpolymath / PanLL ecosystem.
Adjacent projects, in one line each, for session bootstrapping:

- echo-types — constructive Agda formalization of fiber-based structured
  loss ("echo types"); `Echo f y := Σ (x : A) , (f x ≡ y)`. Gated
  identity-claim development; `--safe --without-K` throughout. Current
  workstream: E (ordinal-notation / Buchholz collapsing layer).
  https://github.com/hyperpolymath/echo-types
- PanLL — three-pane cognitive-relief HTI; Ambient/Symbolic/Neural/World panes.
  https://github.com/hyperpolymath/panll
- Gossamer — Zig + WebKitGTK webview shell used by PanLL (~5 MB binary).
- Burble — self-hostable voice-communications platform; Zig-based SIMD
  audio, IEEE 1588 PTP clock sync, sub-second room joining, browser-based
  (no downloads / no accounts), configurable topology from single-server
  to fully distributed mesh. In PanLL, used for team replication via
  broadcast and as a switchable service alongside Gossamer.
- Echidna (hyperpolymath) — planned high-assurance interface verification.
  NOT the Ethereum fuzzer of the same name. Exact repo still to confirm.
- Ephapax — programming language with a linear type system guaranteeing
  memory safety for WebAssembly (compile-time "no use-after-free / no
  memory leaks"). https://github.com/hyperpolymath/ephapax
- VeriSim / VeriSimDB — identity-state capture with filesystem fallback.
- VCL-UT (now VCL-total) — next-generation interaction language for
  VeriSim; designed to satisfy all 10 levels of type safety when
  proposing, inspecting, and verifying operations in a consonance engine
  (rather than querying a passive database).
- Groove protocol — HTTP-based service-discovery mechanism; lets
  capabilities across the hyperpolymath ecosystem announce themselves
  for automatic detection and integration (e.g. discipline-specific
  analyzers becoming visible to PanLL without manual wiring).
  See GROOVE_PANLL_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md in panll.
- ArghDA (planned) — lightweight proof-workspace manager for Agda;
  triage folders (inbox → working → proven/rejected), linter, DAG view.
  Split as `arghda-core` (language-agnostic engine) + `arghda-panll`
  (Gossamer/ReScript presentation). See docs/buchholz-plan.adoc appendix
  for the motivating proof pipeline.

# This repo

echo-types — constructive Agda formalization of fiber-based structured loss
("echo types"). Gated identity-claim development per roadmap-gates.adoc.

Two active workstreams:

1. **Composition track (Echo.agda + echo-types theory docs).** Base
   accumulation iso `Echo-comp-iso-{to, from, from-to, to-from}`
   landed. Cancellation forward/backward maps `cancel-iso-{to, from}`
   landed; full iso deferred pending triangle-identity coherence.
   Pentagon coherence partial: projection-pentagon lemmas
   `Echo-comp-iso-pent-{B, echo}` landed as `refl`; full
   Σ-associativity iso between the two nested Σ-shapes open.

2. **Ordinal track (buchholz-plan.adoc).** Target remains Bachmann–
   Howard (ψ₀(Ω_ω)) as first credible milestone, stretch to ψ(Ω_Ω)
   ≈ TFBO. E1–E7 landed (OT syntax, ℕ-staged closure with
   `C-monotone`, CNF with `cnf-trichotomy`, pedagogical ψ with
   `psi-notin-C`/`psi-least`, Buchholz scaffold with `Cν-monotone`
   family, well-formedness with `BH-wf`/`psi-OmegaOmega-wf`, echo
   bridge with `ordinal-collapse-non-injective`). WF-0 partial
   Buchholz order `_<ᵇ_` and WF-1 well-foundedness `wf-<ᵇ` landed
   for the admitted core (currently `Order.agda`'s 13-constructor
   set including Ω/+ and ψ/+ bridges). Surface / extended / iterated
   / Veblen layers now live under `Ordinal/Buchholz/*` and feed a
   second measure route via `VeblenComparisonModel.agda`.
   Recursive-surface route has a **budgeted** well-foundedness
   `wf-<ᵇʳᶠᵇ` in `RecursiveSurfaceBudget.agda` (carries ℕ budget
   alongside BT); the unbudgeted global WF theorem for `_<ᵇʳᶠ_`
   remains open.

   Open pieces on this track:
   * Full constructor set beyond the admitted core (K-limited
     shared-binder cases such as `<ᵇ-ψα`, `<ᵇ-+2`).
   * Unbudgeted `_<ᵇʳᶠ_` global WF — eliminate the explicit ℕ
     budget from `wf-<ᵇʳᶠᵇ` without leaving `--safe --without-K`.
   * Push the surface-route WF back into `Order.agda`'s main
     `_<ᵇ_` package.

Cross-repo bridge status lives in `docs/echo-types/cross-repo-bridge-status.md`.

# Build

```
cd /home/user/echo-types
agda -i proofs/agda proofs/agda/All.agda
for f in proofs/agda/*.agda proofs/agda/Ordinal/*.agda proofs/agda/Ordinal/Buchholz/*.agda; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && agda -i proofs/agda "$f"
done
```

Requires Agda ≥ 2.6.3 with stdlib ≥ 2.0. On Ubuntu 24.04 with apt's
`agda`/`agda-stdlib` (which ships stdlib 1.7.3 and lacks
`Data.Product.Base`), check out stdlib 2.0 from source:
```
git clone --depth 1 --branch v2.0 https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib.git /opt/agda-stdlib
sed -i 's/^name: standard-library-2.0$/name: standard-library/' /opt/agda-stdlib/standard-library.agda-lib
mkdir -p ~/.agda && echo /opt/agda-stdlib/standard-library.agda-lib > ~/.agda/libraries
```
Then `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 agda proofs/agda/All.agda` exits 0.

# Working rules in this repo

- No postulates unless explicitly isolated and justified.
- `--safe --without-K` throughout.
- Every edit ends with an Agda compile command and captured output.
- Every headline theorem must be pinned in `Smoke.agda` via `using` clause.
- Every new module goes into `All.agda` as an `open import` so the
  verified suite covers it. Orphan modules that compile but are not
  in `All.agda` are treated as dead code.

## Rung-consolidation policy (added 2026-04-23)

Each time a new proof rung lands on the composition or ordinal
tracks (a named theorem or iso-shape), consolidate all outstanding
work to `main` and refresh all documentation:

1. **Branch housekeeping.** Enumerate all open remote branches
   ahead of `main`. Decide which are landing, which are superseded,
   and which are abandoned. Merge the landing ones; mark the
   superseded / abandoned ones in the session ledger.
2. **Cherry-pick to a consolidation branch** off latest `main`, in
   dependency order. Resolve any conflicts (typically additive, in
   `Smoke.agda` and `All.agda`).
3. **Update human docs.** `docs/echo-types/composition.md`,
   `docs/echo-types/roadmap.md`, `docs/echo-types/overview.md` and
   `cross-repo-bridge-status.md` get a sweep for stale `(Open)` /
   `[unblocked]` tags on anything that just landed. Honest labels:
   `(Landed)`, `(Partial)`, `(Open)`.
4. **Update machine docs (this file).** Add the new rung under the
   active-workstream summary. Update the build instructions if the
   toolchain changed. Note any new structural constraints that would
   guide a fresh session's first steps.
5. **Verify.** `agda proofs/agda/All.agda` and `agda proofs/agda/Smoke.agda`
   both exit 0 under `--safe --without-K`. No postulates introduced.
6. **Fast-forward `main`** to the consolidation branch and push.
7. **Session ledger.** In the session response, record the rung
   name, the commits folded in, the remaining open pieces of the
   milestone, and the proposed smallest useful next advance.

## Current rung state (2026-04-23)

Just consolidated: **Budgeted recursive-surface rung** (on top of
the earlier **Pentagon rung**). Folded in:

* Composition-track (already upstream via separate landings):
  `cancel-iso-{to, from}`, `Echo-comp-iso-pent-{B, echo}`.
* Ordinal-track (new on this sweep): `RecursiveSurfaceBudget.agda`
  with `BudgetedBT = ℕ × BT`, `_<ᵇʳᶠᵇ_`, `wf-<ᵇʳᶠᵇ`,
  `<ᵇʳᶠᵇ-irreflexive`, and the `<ᵇʳᶠᵇ⇒lifted` bridge into the
  iterated-wrapper tower. Auxiliary layers (`ExtendedOrder`,
  `LiftedExtendedOrder`, `IteratedExtendedOrder`,
  `RecursiveSurfaceOrder`, `SurfaceOrder`, `VeblenInterface`,
  `VeblenIdentityModel`, `VeblenMeasureTarget`,
  `VeblenProjectionMeasure`, `VeblenComparisonTarget`,
  `VeblenComparisonModel`, `VeblenObligations`) are all wired
  into `All.agda` and pinned in `Ordinal/Buchholz/Smoke.agda`.

Open at this rung:

* Composition side: full cancel-iso round-trips (needs triangle
  identity); full Σ-associativity iso for pentagon; approximate-echo
  skeleton `EchoApprox.agda`.
* Ordinal side: unbudgeted global WF for `_<ᵇʳᶠ_` — eliminate the
  explicit ℕ budget from `wf-<ᵇʳᶠᵇ` without leaving `--safe --without-K`;
  then push that back into `Order.agda`'s `_<ᵇ_` package so the
  WF proof covers the full surface route rather than the admitted
  core only.

Verified post-rebase: `agda proofs/agda/All.agda` and
`agda proofs/agda/Smoke.agda` both exit 0 under `--safe --without-K`.
No postulates introduced.
