# Buchholz `_<ᵇ⁺_`: well-foundedness gap

`Ordinal.Buchholz.OrderExtended._<ᵇ⁺_` adds two shared-binder lex
constructors on top of `Ordinal.Buchholz.Order._<ᵇ_`:

* **`<ᵇ⁺-ψα`** — `bpsi ν α <ᵇ⁺ bpsi ν β` whenever `α <ᵇ β`
  (lex on the ψ-argument at a fixed Ω-index).
* **`<ᵇ⁺-+2`** — `bplus x y₁ <ᵇ⁺ bplus x y₂` whenever `y₁ <ᵇ y₂`
  (lex on the right summand at a fixed left summand).

`<ᵇ⁺-irrefl` and `<ᵇ⁺-trans` are proved. **Well-foundedness for
`_<ᵇ⁺_` is open.** This note records why and sketches the two
viable design routes.

## Why `wf-<ᵇ` does not extend directly

`Ordinal.Buchholz.WellFounded.wf-<ᵇ` is built from a per-Ω-index
bundle:

```agda
ΩBundle μ = Acc _<ᵇ_ (bOmega μ) × ((α : BT) → Acc _<ᵇ_ (bpsi μ α))

<ᵇ-bundle-fromΩ : ∀ {μ} → Acc _<Ω_ μ → ΩBundle μ
```

The bundle's `psiAcc α` returns `Acc _<ᵇ_ (bpsi μ α)` for any `α`,
discharging predecessors via case analysis on `_<ᵇ_`'s
constructors. The new `<ᵇ⁺-ψα` constructor introduces predecessors
shaped `bpsi μ β` for arbitrary `β <ᵇ α`. Discharging those needs
recursion on `Acc _<ᵇ_ α` — but `psiAcc` does not carry an `Acc α`
argument, so the natural attempt

```agda
predPsi α (<ᵇ-ψα {α = β} refl _) = psiAcc β
```

calls `psiAcc β` with `β` strictly smaller than `α` only via
`<ᵇ`, not structurally. Agda's termination checker rejects the
mutual cycle `predPsi → psiAcc → predPsi` because the first
argument does not decrease.

Symmetrically, `<ᵇ⁺-+2` introduces predecessors `bplus α y₁` for
arbitrary `y₁ <ᵇ y₂`, and the existing `<ᵇ-acc-bplus-from` only
threads `Acc _<ᵇ_ α` (the left summand), so the right-summand lex
case has no decreasing measure either.

## Two design routes

### Route A — single-mutual block with widened bundle

Replace the per-Ω-index bundle with a single mutual block in
which:

```agda
ΩBundle μ = Acc _<ᵇ_ (bOmega μ)
          × ((α : BT) → Acc _<ᵇ_ α → Acc _<ᵇ_ (bpsi μ α))

<ᵇ-acc-bplus-from-both :
  ∀ {α β} → Acc _<ᵇ_ α → Acc _<ᵇ_ β → Acc _<ᵇ_ (bplus α β)
```

i.e. the ψ-side of the bundle takes `Acc _<ᵇ_ α` as a parameter,
and `bplus`-acc takes `Acc _<ᵇ_` for **both** summands. `wf-<ᵇ`
becomes mutual with the bundle and supplies the extra `Acc` args
via BT structural recursion (`wf-<ᵇ α` for the smaller subterm).

**Status of attempt.** Drafted twice (in this PR and again by a
parallel session on 2026-04-28); both attempts are
constructionally identical and both are rejected by Agda's
termination checker. The reported cycle is
`pred-bpsi-from → wf-<ᵇ → <ᵇ-acc-bpsi → <ᵇ-acc-bpsi-from`. The
cycle is well-founded in lex order on
`(BT-structure of carrier, witness)`, but Agda does not see the
witness as decreasing the BT carrier without an explicit
size-measure annotation. A sized-types or explicit measure
encoding (e.g. via `Induction.WellFounded.<-rec` with a measure
into ℕ × ℕ) is the next thing to try; failing that, fall back
to Route B.

### Route B — rank-embedding into Brouwer ordinals

Define `rank : BT → Ord` (Brouwer, already present in
`Ordinal.Brouwer`) such that `x <ᵇ⁺ y → rank x < rank y`. Then
WF for `_<ᵇ⁺_` follows from `Ordinal.Brouwer.wf-<` by
transport along `rank`.

Sketch of `rank`:

```agda
rank bzero        = oz
rank (bOmega μ)   = ω-rank μ
rank (bplus α β)  = rank α ⊕ rank β
rank (bpsi μ α)   = psi-rank μ ⊕ rank α   -- conjectural form
```

The arithmetic infrastructure (`_⊕_`, `nat-to-ord`, `ω-rank`,
`psi-rank`) is in `Ordinal.Brouwer.Arithmetic`. The strict
decrease must hold on every `<ᵇ⁺` constructor:

* `<ᵇ-ψΩ μ<ν` — Ω-index decrease must dominate the ψ-arg
  comparison; needs `psi-rank` to be strictly monotone in μ at a
  rate that swamps `_⊕_`-additions of the ψ-arg.
* `<ᵇ⁺-ψα` — ψ-arg strict decrease at fixed μ; needs
  `psi-rank μ ⊕ ·` to preserve `<` on the right.
* `<ᵇ⁺-+2` — right-summand strict decrease at fixed left;
  needs `· ⊕ rank α` to be `<`-monotone on the left.

**Status.** Not attempted yet. The constructive Brouwer-ordinal
arithmetic in this repo is light (Phase 1.1/1.2); some of the
strict-monotonicity lemmas the `rank` proof would need are not
yet present.

## Pragmatic interim — leave `_<ᵇ_` and `_<ᵇ⁺_` separate

Today's commit ships the constructors in `_<ᵇ⁺_` only, leaving
`Ordinal.Buchholz.Order._<ᵇ_` (and its `wf-<ᵇ`) intact. Downstream
consumers that need only the K-free core (e.g. the
`VeblenComparisonModel` chain) keep their existing WF guarantee.
Consumers that need the lex cases use `_<ᵇ⁺_` and accept that
WF is not yet established for it.

## Recommended next attempt (HISTORICAL — superseded 2026-05-20)

Route B (rank-embedding) was previously labelled lower-risk because
the arithmetic lemmas needed seemed bounded and discoverable. That
verdict is now **WRONG**.

**Route B is impossible** for the current `_<ᵇ_`. The constructor
`<ᵇ-+Ω : x <ᵇ bOmega μ → bplus x y <ᵇ bOmega μ` is ordinally unsound
(concrete refutation: `bplus bzero (bOmega (fin 1)) <ᵇ bOmega (fin 0)`
exists via `<ᵇ-+Ω <ᵇ-0-Ω`, but any additive `rank` gives the LHS
larger than the RHS). No additive, multiplicative, or constructive
ordinal arithmetic on `rank x` and `rank y` resolves the joint
`<ᵇ-+Ω` ∧ `<ᵇʳᶠ-+2` tension. See `buchholz-rank-obstruction.adoc`
for the full analysis. Verified empirically 2026-05-20 that *all five*
plausible routes are walled — rank-embedding, direct mutual structural
recursion (Agda termination error: `wf-<ᵇʳᶠ x₂` non-decreasing), tower-
stratification through `LiftedOrder` (refuted by `surfaceLiftBlocked`'s
shape — wrapper non-self-stability propagates upward), lex-measure
into ℕ, and inverse-image into `_<ᵇʳᶠᵇ_`.

Route A's "Agda termination checker is harder to debug than provable
mathematics" framing is also corrected: the mathematics turns out
not to be provable at all for the current `_<ᵇ_`. The termination
check was the right oracle.

**What this means.** Both `_<ᵇ⁺_` and `_<ᵇʳᶠ_` retain their
budgeted forms as the canonical well-foundedness statements
(`_<ᵇ⁺ᵇ_` newly in `Ordinal.Buchholz.OrderExtendedBudget`,
mirroring the existing `_<ᵇʳᶠᵇ_`). To recover unbudgeted WF would
require either restricting `_<ᵇ_` to a `WellFormed` subset
(2–3 weeks of constructor-by-constructor rework + transitivity +
inversion re-proof) or providing a non-additive denotational
measure (essentially solving Buchholz WF "from the model up", a
substantially larger project than the rank-embedding route was
ever framed as).
