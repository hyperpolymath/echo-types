------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- HISTORICAL BROKEN BANNER (resolved 2026-05-27).
--
-- This module previously failed the typechecker (UnsolvedConstraints
-- + UnsolvedMetaVariables across lines ~150–200, around
-- `EchoChoreo.obs` reindex metas) and was deliberately excluded from
-- `characteristic/All.agda` per the 2026-05-18 audit.
--
-- Resolution (2026-05-27). The unsolved metas were not a content
-- blocker but an *inference* blocker: `RoleGEcho r keep` unfolds to
-- `Echo (obs r) true`, and Agda cannot recover `r` from the carrier
-- alone because `obs : Role → (Global → Bool)` is not injective.
-- Pinning the implicit `r1`/`r2` (and the implicit grade) at the
-- four `applyRole` / `applyGrade` call sites resolves the metas
-- without changing the content of any lemma. The module is now in
-- `characteristic/All.agda`.
--
-- CONSEQUENCE FOR THE CLAIM BELOW: the "VERDICT … SURVIVES" line is
-- now mechanised. The Rev-5 audit at `docs/characteristic.adoc`
-- §"Evidence reviewed" item 3 (originally noting the broken status)
-- has been updated to note the resolution and the
-- decision-not-to-promote-N5 rationale (see Rev-5 §"What the
-- re-audit explicitly does NOT do" item 1: the candidate's only
-- non-trivial cell remains the `(c⊑s, keep≤keep)` Choreo content
-- already credited to N3, so adoption would be cosmetic — that
-- conclusion is unchanged by N5Falsifier becoming green).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Gate 2 audit: N5Falsifier
--
-- VERDICT (NOT MECHANISED — see broken banner above): the N5 candidate
-- (`characteristic.RoleGraded.choreo-grade-commute`) was *intended* to
-- be shown to SURVIVE the sharpened falsifier. This is an
-- attempt-of-record, not a result.
--
-- Background. STATE.next-actions q2-3 (low-priority bookkeeping
-- post-EI-2) calls for adopting `choreo-grade-commute` as nominee N5.
-- The gate-2 audit doc surface flagged it as a candidate fifth nominee
-- but did not adopt pending a falsifier attempt of the same shape that
-- successfully struck down N3 (`knowledge-and-controlled-degradation`,
-- formalised in `characteristic.IntegrationAudit`).
--
-- The N3 sharpened falsifier exhibited:
--
--   * `split-knowledge` — pure-choreo restatement (no `degrade`).
--   * `split-merging`   — pure-grade restatement (no role).
--   * `N3-is-product`   — original ≡ literal pair of the two splits.
--   * `split-merging-uses-no-hypotheses` — conjunct 2 ignores N3's
--     hypotheses, witnessing "no shared data between conjuncts".
--
-- For N5, the same shape is structurally inapplicable: both sides of
-- the equation reference both decoration witnesses (`rp`, `gp`) and
-- the same data (`e`). There is no pair of pure-axis facts whose
-- product reproduces the theorem, because the content of N5 is the
-- *coincidence* of two action orderings on shared data.
--
-- Honest narrowing (per STATE standing-decisions sd-002). The recipe
-- is organising vocabulary, NOT distinctness load. Adoption of N5 is
-- bookkeeping completion of the gate-2 nominee table; the gate-1
-- distinctness load is carried by truncation (echo-not-prop family)
-- and 2-cell arguments (Sophisticated submodules), independently of
-- this theorem.
--
-- Recommendation (closing). Add `RoleGraded.choreo-grade-commute` as
-- the fifth gate-2 nominee N5 in `roadmap-gates.adoc`, raising the
-- audit count to 5-of-5 across the four characteristic constructions.

-- (`rp`, `gp`, `e`). Below, `LHS` and `RHS` package each side as a
-- function consuming the full triple, making the data-dependency
-- syntactic. Compare with N3, where `split-merging` was a closed term
-- referencing none of N3's hypotheses; here neither side admits a
-- closed-form restatement that drops one of `rp`, `gp`, or `e`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Why the N3-shape falsifier does not apply
--
-- For N3, exhibiting `(split-knowledge , split-merging)` as the
-- literal product was possible because the original was a `_×_` of
-- two facts that named no common term. For N5, neither side admits
-- a single-axis restatement at all: stripping `applyRole` from
-- `LHS rp gp e` discards the `rp` dependency, but the resulting term
-- `applyGrade gp e` no longer has the type of the original LHS
-- (which lives in `RoleGEcho r2 g2`, not `RoleGEcho r1 g2`).
--
-- The structural witness of inapplicability is therefore: there is
-- no pair `(P-choreo, P-grade)` of pure-axis statements such that
-- `P-choreo × P-grade` has the type of `N5-equation`. A formal
-- impossibility proof would require quantifying over Agda terms
-- (meta-level), but the type-level obstruction is visible in the
-- signatures of `LHS` and `RHS` above: both ineliminably consume
-- all three binders.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Single-axis collapses (both decorations forced to identity)
--
-- When both `rp` and `gp` are identity steps (`c⊑c`/`s⊑s` and
-- `keep≤keep`), the equation degenerates to reflexivity on `e`.
-- These cells witness the *absence* of substantive content in the
-- single-axis halves: if N5 *were* a product of pure-axis facts, the
-- collapses below would expose non-trivial pure-axis content. They
-- do not — they all close by `refl` because identity steps are
-- identity.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- (rp, gp) = (c⊑c, keep≤keep): both sides reduce to `e ≡ e`.
-- Roles are passed explicitly because `obs : Role → (Global → Bool)`
-- is not injective on its function-extensionality target, so
-- inferring `r1`/`r2` from the `RoleGEcho r keep = Echo (obs r) true`
-- carrier requires the user to pin them. This is what the
-- 2026-05-18 "unsolved metas" disclosure was tracking; the
-- explicit-role fix lands as the 2026-05-26 N5 sharpening per
-- `docs/characteristic.adoc` Rev 5.

-- The non-trivial cell (c⊑s, keep≤keep)
--
-- The single non-trivial cell of N5. Both sides reduce to

-- only the identity step `keep≤keep`, which does not enter the

-- Closing
--
-- The N5 candidate survives the sharpened falsifier. Recommended
-- action: amend `roadmap-gates.adoc` to add
-- `RoleGraded.choreo-grade-commute` as the fifth gate-2 nominee N5,
-- with this file linked from the gate-2 audit doc surface as the
-- falsifier-attempt record.
--
-- Per the set-2 task spec, this file deliberately modifies nothing
-- existing. Registering N5Falsifier in `proofs/agda/All.agda` (so the
-- verified suite covers it, per project convention) is the
-- integrator's call.
