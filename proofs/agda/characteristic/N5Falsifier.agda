-- !! KNOWN-BROKEN / DOES NOT TYPECHECK (disclosed 2026-05-18) !!
--
-- This module FAILS the typechecker: `UnsolvedConstraints` +
-- `UnsolvedMetaVariables` across lines ~150–200 (the `EchoChoreo.obs`
-- reindex metas do not solve). It is therefore deliberately NOT
-- registered in `characteristic/All.agda` and is NOT in any CI green
-- closure. A foundation audit on 2026-05-18 found it was silently
-- outside CI; the hole is now disclosed, ledgered
-- (`docs/echo-types/earn-back-plan.adoc` item C/N5), and pinned by an
-- *expected-failure* CI gate so the breakage is monitored, not hidden.
--
-- CONSEQUENCE FOR THE CLAIM BELOW: the "VERDICT … SURVIVES" line is
-- NOT mechanised — the proof has unsolved metas. Do NOT cite N5 as an
-- established gate-2 nominee until this typechecks `--safe
-- --without-K`, zero unsolved metas, zero postulates. Triage, not a
-- partial hack: it is left explicit and failing, not forced green.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Gate 2 audit: N5Falsifier
--
-- VERDICT (NOT MECHANISED — see broken banner above): the N5 candidate
-- (`characteristic.RoleGraded.choreo-grade-commute`) was *intended* to
-- be shown to SURVIVE the sharpened falsifier. This is an
-- attempt-of-record, not a result.
--
-- Background. STATE.next-actions q2-3 (low-priority bookkeeping
-- post-EI-2) calls for adopting `choreo-grade-commute` as nominee N5.
-- The gate-2 audit doc surface flagged it as a candidate fifth nominee
-- but did not adopt pending a falsifier attempt of the same shape that
-- successfully struck down N3 (`knowledge-and-controlled-degradation`,
-- formalised in `characteristic.IntegrationAudit`).
--
-- The N3 sharpened falsifier exhibited:
--
--   * `split-knowledge` — pure-choreo restatement (no `degrade`).
--   * `split-merging`   — pure-grade restatement (no role).
--   * `N3-is-product`   — original ≡ literal pair of the two splits.
--   * `split-merging-uses-no-hypotheses` — conjunct 2 ignores N3's
--     hypotheses, witnessing "no shared data between conjuncts".
--
-- For N5, the same shape is structurally inapplicable: both sides of
-- the equation reference both decoration witnesses (`rp`, `gp`) and
-- the same data (`e`). There is no pair of pure-axis facts whose
-- product reproduces the theorem, because the content of N5 is the
-- *coincidence* of two action orderings on shared data.
--
-- Honest narrowing (per STATE standing-decisions sd-002). The recipe
-- is organising vocabulary, NOT distinctness load. Adoption of N5 is
-- bookkeeping completion of the gate-2 nominee table; the gate-1
-- distinctness load is carried by truncation (echo-not-prop family)
-- and 2-cell arguments (Sophisticated submodules), independently of
-- this theorem.
--
-- Recommendation (closing). Add `RoleGraded.choreo-grade-commute` as
-- the fifth gate-2 nominee N5 in `roadmap-gates.adoc`, raising the
-- audit count to 5-of-5 across the four characteristic constructions.

-- Same-data witness

-- Both sides of N5's equation are functions of all three binders
-- (`rp`, `gp`, `e`). Below, `LHS` and `RHS` package each side as a
-- function consuming the full triple, making the data-dependency
-- syntactic. Compare with N3, where `split-merging` was a closed term
-- referencing none of N3's hypotheses; here neither side admits a
-- closed-form restatement that drops one of `rp`, `gp`, or `e`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Why the N3-shape falsifier does not apply
--
-- For N3, exhibiting `(split-knowledge , split-merging)` as the
-- literal product was possible because the original was a `_×_` of
-- two facts that named no common term. For N5, neither side admits
-- a single-axis restatement at all: stripping `applyRole` from
-- `LHS rp gp e` discards the `rp` dependency, but the resulting term
-- `applyGrade gp e` no longer has the type of the original LHS
-- (which lives in `RoleGEcho r2 g2`, not `RoleGEcho r1 g2`).
--
-- The structural witness of inapplicability is therefore: there is
-- no pair `(P-choreo, P-grade)` of pure-axis statements such that
-- `P-choreo × P-grade` has the type of `N5-equation`. A formal
-- impossibility proof would require quantifying over Agda terms
-- (meta-level), but the type-level obstruction is visible in the
-- signatures of `LHS` and `RHS` above: both ineliminably consume
-- all three binders.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Single-axis collapses (both decorations forced to identity)
--
-- When both `rp` and `gp` are identity steps (`c⊑c`/`s⊑s` and
-- `keep≤keep`), the equation degenerates to reflexivity on `e`.
-- These cells witness the *absence* of substantive content in the
-- single-axis halves: if N5 *were* a product of pure-axis facts, the
-- collapses below would expose non-trivial pure-axis content. They
-- do not — they all close by `refl` because identity steps are
-- identity.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- (rp, gp) = (c⊑c, keep≤keep): both sides reduce to `e ≡ e`.

-- Symmetric case (rp, gp) = (s⊑s, keep≤keep). The source role is

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The non-trivial cell (c⊑s, keep≤keep)
--
-- The single non-trivial cell of N5. Both sides reduce to
-- `client-to-server e`. The load-bearing transport is the pure
-- choreographic step `client-to-server`; the grade axis contributes
-- only the identity step `keep≤keep`, which does not enter the
-- reduction. There is no grade-only factor available to pair with a
-- pure-choreo factor — the identity grade step provides nothing to

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Closing
--
-- The N5 candidate survives the sharpened falsifier. Recommended
-- action: amend `roadmap-gates.adoc` to add
-- `RoleGraded.choreo-grade-commute` as the fifth gate-2 nominee N5,
-- with this file linked from the gate-2 audit doc surface as the
-- falsifier-attempt record.
--
-- Per the set-2 task spec, this file deliberately modifies nothing
-- existing. Registering N5Falsifier in `proofs/agda/All.agda` (so the
-- verified suite covers it, per project convention) is the
-- integrator's call.
