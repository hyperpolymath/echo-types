-- Per-decoration composition. The grade decoration commutes with
-- composition: any factoring of a transition `g1 ≤g g3` through an
-- intermediate grade `g2` yields the same degraded echo, regardless of
-- which intermediate is chosen, and is moreover indistinguishable from
-- the direct degrade. This is the per-decoration analogue of pentagon
-- coherence — different paths through the decoration order collapse.
--
-- The proof is a corollary of `degrade-comp` (associativity along the
-- chosen factoring) and `≤g-prop` (any two paths through `_≤g_` agree),
-- so the per-decoration story rests cleanly on those two ingredients.

-- Join-action specialisation: degrading directly to a common upper
-- bound `g` agrees with degrading first to the join `g1 ⊔g g2` and
-- then onward via the universal arrow. This is the per-decoration
