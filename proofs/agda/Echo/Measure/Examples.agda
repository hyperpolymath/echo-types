-- Echo.Measure.Examples — concrete residue measures over the
-- canonical loss modality `grade-echoModality`.
--
-- These DEMONSTRATE that the residue-measure seam
-- (`Echo.Measure.Interface`) admits the usual resource readings —
-- cost, tropical (min-plus) cost, and probability/confidence — WITHOUT
-- any of them entering Echo core. They live here, in
-- `Echo.Measure.Examples`, precisely so they do not pollute
-- `Echo.Modality.Core`.
--
-- Each example is a `ResidueMeasure grade-echoModality R`: a measure on
-- the three-point loss residues into an ordered carrier `R`, with the
-- monotonicity law discharged. They also show the variance is a free
-- choice of the carrier's order: the cost/tropical readings use `ℕ`
-- with `≤` (degradation accumulates cost), while the confidence
-- reading uses `ℕ` with the OPPOSITE order (degradation lowers
-- confidence) — same seam, opposite variance.

-- Example 2 — a tropical-cost measure.
--
-- The carrier `ℕ-≤` is exactly the order-reduct of the tropical
-- (min-plus) semiring `(ℕ, min, +, ≤)`: the seam needs only the order,
-- so this measure lands in the tropical carrier under its natural
-- order. (The `min` / `+` operations are not exercised here — the seam
-- is order-only; a measure that also composes additively along
-- degradation would supply them.) A different cost profile from
-- Example 1 — `keep` and `residue` are both free, only `forget` costs
-- (1) — so it also shows many distinct measures inhabit one carrier.
