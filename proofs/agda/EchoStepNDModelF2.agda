-- Gate F2 feasibility spike (docs/echo-types/earn-back-plan.adoc §"Gate
-- F2 — A real second model of the *bare* Echo functor").
--
-- The R-2026-05-18 retraction noted that `EchoRelModel`'s "second
-- model" is not genuinely independent: its relational instance is the
-- Set model's carrier `× ⊤`, its step relation is the *total* relation
-- `RStep _ _ = ⊤` (a disguised graph), and `model-agreement` is `refl`.
-- The one R2 item rated "fixable with bounded work" was: give a model
-- that genuinely uses a NON-deterministic step relation that is *not*
-- the graph of a function, with the Echo-functor laws holding and an
-- agreement with the deterministic model that has real content (not
-- `refl`, not Σ-η on `× ⊤`), and that does NOT degenerate by
-- collapsing the relation back to a graph.
--
-- This spike uses `EchoRelational.StepND` — a genuinely
-- non-deterministic relation (state `false` reaches BOTH `false` and
-- `true`). It delivers:
--
--   1. `EchoFunctorModel` — the interface the deterministic Echo
--      model satisfies (carrier + functorial reindex + id/comp laws),
--      instantiated at the deterministic graph model AND at the
--      `StepND` model: the functor laws hold for both, by the same
--      generic proofs (`map-rel-id` / `map-rel-comp`).
--   2. `nd-not-graph` — a CHECKED proof (`true ≢ false`) that `StepND`
--      is NOT the graph of any function, under any state relabelling.
--      So the model cannot be obtained by trivialising the relation
--      back to a graph: the gate's failure clause is positively
--      excluded, not merely avoided.
--   3. `det→nd` — a relational morphism from the deterministic model
--      INTO the `StepND` model whose witness-preservation is genuine
--      constructor case analysis (emits different `StepND`
--      constructors per branch): a non-`refl`, non-Σ-η obligation.
--   4. `nd-fibre-is-sum` — the agreement with content: the `StepND`
--      echo-fibre over `true` is the disjoint sum of its two branch
--      fibres, established by case analysis on the `StepND`
--      constructors (a real bijection, not `refl`, not graph-collapse:
--      a non-deterministic relation IS a sum of deterministic
--      branches, and that decomposition is the honest agreement).
--
-- --safe --without-K, ZERO postulates. Not wired into `All.agda` /
-- `Smoke.agda` until Gate F2 is recorded passed.

-- 1. The interface the deterministic Echo model satisfies.
--
-- An Echo-functor model over a fixed output type is a step relation
-- together with the carrier `EchoStep` and the functorial reindexing
-- `map-rel` satisfying the identity and composition laws. The
-- deterministic model takes `Step = Graph g`; the F2 model takes
-- `Step = StepND`. The laws are the SAME generic proofs in both.

-- Functoriality is the identity law plus the composition law for the
-- model's own (endo) reindexings. Quantifying the composition law over
-- the model's *own* relation `Step` (not free `Step'`/`Step''`) is the
-- faithful "functor laws hold" statement and keeps every relation
-- determined — the generic `map-rel-id` / `map-rel-comp` discharge it.

-- 4. The agreement, WITH CONTENT. A non-deterministic relation is, at

-- echo-fibre over `true` is exactly the disjoint sum of its two
-- branch fibres — the `stay-true` branch (state `true`) and the
-- `flip-to-true` branch (state `false`). The bijection is established
-- by CASE ANALYSIS on the `StepND` constructors, not by `refl`/Σ-η,
-- and not by collapsing to a graph (which §2 proved impossible). This
-- IS the honest agreement of the nd model with deterministic data:
-- not "nd = some graph" but "nd = a structured sum of graphs".
